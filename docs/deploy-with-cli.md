# Deploying from the command line 

As an alternative to deploying with GitHub Actions, you can use the included
deployment script to deploy the Contoso Ads sample app. This gives you
a bit more flexibility for naming resources and selecting specific container
images.

## Prerequisites

You'll need an Azure subscription and a very small set of tools and skills to get started:

1. An Azure subscription. Sign up [for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
2. Either the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed locally, or the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) available online.
3. If you are using a local installation of the Azure CLI:
  1. You need a bash shell to execute the included deployment script - on Windows 10/11 use the [Window Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
  2. Make sure to have Bicep CLI installed by running `az bicep install`.

## Setup

By the end of this section you'll have Contoso Ads running in Azure. This setup process requires you to run a
single deployment script, and should take you around 5-10 minutes.

Before executing the deployment script, you have to export two environment variables:
* `CONTOSOADS_RESOURCE_GROUP` must be set to the name of the resource group that hosts all resources for the sample app.
  The script will also create the resource group itself.
* `CONTOSOADS_DB_PWD` must be set to the password for the database user used by the application to access PostgreSQL.
* `CONTOSOADS_REPO` must be set to your GitHub repo's URL (i.e., the URL of your clone of this repo).
Then, navigate tp the `deploy` directory and run `deploy.sh`:

```bash
cd contosoads-containerapp/deploy
export CONTOSOADS_RESOURCE_GROUP=<your-resource-group-name>
export CONTOSOADS_DB_PWD=$(openssl rand -hex 20)
export CONTOSOADS_REPO=<your-github-repo-url>
./deploy.sh
```

All resources are created in the same region. You can override the default settings
of the deployment script by exporting the following environment variables:

| Environment variable            | Purpose                                    | Default value |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `CONTOSOADS_LOCATION`           | Azure region to deploy to                  | `northeurope` |
| `CONTOSOADS_BASE_NAME`          | Common name prefix for Azure resources     | `contosoads`  |
| `CONTOSOADS_WEBAPP_TAG`         | Web app container image tag                | `latest`      |
| `CONTOSOADS_IMAGEPROCESSOR_TAG` | Image processor container image tag        | `latest`      |
| `CONTOSOADS_POSTGRES_VERSION`   | PostgreSQL version to use (12, 13, or 14)  | `14`          |

The deployment script will create the following resources:

| Resource                               | Resource Type                                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                          |
